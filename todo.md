# TODO

1. Add transfer tracks for loading / offloading trains during operation
2. Add variable load/unload times **[DONE]**
3. Add dual/quad load synchronization
4. Add real examples and analyze capacity
5. Finish moving logic into block.py, train.py **[DONE]**
6. Add more complex block functionality for rides with switch tracks
7. Add GUI to visualize flow of operations in realtime
8. Build runbook in Google Colab for no-code operation
9. Can this simulator be used to test out different operational strategies?
   - for example, if operators learn to wait X seconds before dispatching a train, does it actually improve operations?
   - what else would we have to account for here to test that?
